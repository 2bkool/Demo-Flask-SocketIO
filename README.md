# Demo-Flask-SocketIO

Took some time to explore the Flask-SocketIO from Miguel 

Look for the blog post here: <a href="http://timmyreilly.azurewebsites.net/flask-socketio-and-more/">TimmyReilly.com</a>

In the process I've learned about some sweet stuff you can do with Javascript, Python, and Flask-SocketIO.


<span style="color: black;">Flask is the tiny server that allows us to host websites using Python to deliver content to the client. While on the server side you can manage complicated back ends or other processes using Python in conjunction with Flask.</span>

<strong>The five steps to this little demo project are as follows:</strong>
1. Install Flask-SocketIO into our Virtual Environment

2. Create our background thread

3. Have it emit the current state to our client

4. Call the background thread when our page render_template's

5. Have the Javascript Catch the emit and format our HTML.

Celebrate! Its Friday!
